            <h1>The Benefits of Data Sharing</h1>

            <h2>Why do you need my data anyway?</h2>

            <h2>Data sharing not only provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers, but it also enables us to improve our services.</h2>

                    <p>Data sharing means more employers, more job listings, and more job seekers</p>
                    
                   <p>Data sharing between the Platforms allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers. It also helps employers
                     access more job seekers. For example, one platform may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another platform. It can also help applications,
                      resumes, or job listings work across the Platforms.  The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the platforms in the course of your job search and application activities.</p>
                    
                   <p>The Platforms can also share employer data, such as account information and behavioral information, to provide a better experience to those employers.</p>
                    
            <h2>Data sharing improves our services</h2>
                    
                   <p>Data sharing allows our Platforms to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features, and services.</p> 
                    
                   <p> For example, our Platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history and
                     your resume or profile information to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Data sharing may also help provide 
                     career insights such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips, and more. </p>

            <h2>Data sharing facilitates better security</h2>

                    <p>Sharing data allows our Platforms to better protect our users. In particular, it allows affiliated Platforms to improve user
                         security and internal operations. It also facilitates troubleshooting and detection, and prevention of fraud and spam.</p>
