              <h1>A.Terms Of Service For Job Seekers</h1>

              <h2>1.Job Ads or Job Listings</h2>

              <p>Job Onboard may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Job Onboard’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
                 Searching for Job Ads on Job Onboard is free for Job Seekers. Job Onboard displays Job Ads based on a combination of compensation paid by employers to Job Onboard and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted
                  on Job Onboard. While Job Onboard may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Job Onboard job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.</p>

                  <h2>Resume and Profile</h2>   

                     <p>By creating a searchable resume through the Site (“Job Onboard Resume”) or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively,
                     “Your Resume” or “Job Seeker Resume”), you are requesting and authorizing Job Onboard to make available Your Resume to anyone
                      accessing our Site, such as Employers that Indeed believes may have an interest in Your Resume, users of Job Onboard’s Resume
                       Search Program, or anyone with access to the URL associated with your searchable resume. We offer you the option to make
                        Your Resume searchable on Indeed to help you find a job. You are responsible for keeping Your Resume accurate and up-to-date.</p>

                     <h2>3.Applying To Jobs Through Job Onboard</h2>  
                     
                     <p>Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application
                         or responses to screener questions and assessments (“Job Onboard Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.) and to 
                         Job Onboard’s Privacy Policy (all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply
                          with Job Onboard”,  “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean  “Job Onboard Apply.”). To maintain the quality of the Site and Services,
                           Job Onboard in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Job Onboard services.</p>

            <h2>Job Matching and Recommended Jobs</h2>

            <p>Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as a Job Seeker and to Employers in various formats on the Site. 
                For example, Indeed may recommend Job Ads which are similar to jobs to which you recently applied, or recommend Resumes to Employers 
                which match Job Ads they post. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program</p>

                <h2>Communications and Other Actions On The Site </h2>

                <p>When you view, send, store or receive communications or materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, text messages, applications, questions and 
                    responses in applications, and any other information)  on or through the Site, you agree to your communication and materials being processed, analyzed,
                     reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Job Onboard policies,
                      content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Job Onboard product or service whether via automated means or otherwise. If you disagree with any
                       part of these terms, do not use the Site.</p>

            <h2>6.Virtual Communications</h2>

                <p>Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual, pre-recorded, and remote communications using Job Onboard products, including but not limited to,
                     Job Onboard Interview, Job Onboard Hiring Platform, Virtual Evaluations, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews. You understand
                      that Job Onboard is not a telecommunications service provider and that Job Onbboard is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that
                       may be offered by third-party providers. Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there
                        may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit,
                         or support such phone or video communications. Job Onboard does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video
                          communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions. Job Onboard is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual
                           Interviews and you release Job Onboard from any such claims.</p>


            <h2>7.Screening Tools</h2>

                <p>Job Onboard may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.
                    Job Onboard is licensing these tools for Employers’ use as determined by Employers. As a Job Seeker you agree that the Employer has made the determination to use these
                      tools as part of its application process, and the questions asked are solely determined by the Employer, and are not being asked by Job Onboard. The Employer is the sole
                       party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate and is solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.</p>

            <h2>8.Job Onboard Assessments</h2>

                <p>Job Onboard Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers and responses from Job Seekers
                    through the Site. Employers may use the Job Onboard Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses. After you provide a Response, the Employer will be
                     able to use the Job Onboard Assessments platform to review the Response.</p>
